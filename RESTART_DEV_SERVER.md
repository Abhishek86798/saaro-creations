# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Restart Your Dev Server

## The Fix is Complete, But You Need to Restart!

The infinite loop error you're seeing is from **cached code in your browser and dev server**.

### Step 1: Stop the Dev Server
In your terminal where `pnpm dev` is running:
- Press `Ctrl+C`
- Wait for it to fully stop

### Step 2: Clear the .next Cache (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
```

### Step 3: Restart the Dev Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Your Browser
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

Or:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## What to Expect

âœ… **No more console errors**  
âœ… **No "getServerSnapshot should be cached" warning**  
âœ… **No "Maximum update depth exceeded" error**  
âœ… **Cart works perfectly**  
âœ… **Page loads smoothly**

## If You Still See Errors

1. Make sure you fully stopped the old dev server
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Close all browser tabs with localhost:3000
4. Restart dev server again
5. Open a fresh browser tab

## Production Build Already Works!

The production build (`pnpm build`) is already successful. This is just a dev server cache issue.

Once you restart, everything will work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
